3.- Survey:
	By exploring different websites I can see that the most atractive ones are those that show with different images and icons the different services they provide and the technologies they use. Also some of them show the utility and application of certain technologies in a visual and attractive way.

	The less apealing wites are those that only show paragraphs of information.
